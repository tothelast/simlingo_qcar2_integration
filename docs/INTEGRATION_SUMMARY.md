# SimLingo-Qcar2 Integration Summary

## Project Overview

This project successfully integrates the SimLingo Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with the Qcar2 platform for autonomous driving in the Qlabs virtual environment. SimLingo, originally developed for the CARLA simulator, has been adapted to work with Quanser's Qcar2 vehicle system.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Research and Information Gathering
- **SimLingo Model Analysis**: Studied the model architecture, input/output formats, and CARLA-specific implementations
- **Qcar2 SDK Understanding**: Documented the control API, sensor data access, and Qlabs integration
- **Integration Requirements**: Mapped differences between CARLA and Qcar2 interfaces

### ✅ Project Setup and Environment
- **Directory Structure**: Created organized project structure with dedicated folders for source code, models, tests, and documentation
- **Python Environment**: Set up virtual environment with all required dependencies including PyTorch 2.2.0, transformers, OpenCV, and HuggingFace Hub
- **Model Download**: Successfully downloaded the SimLingo model (3.7GB) from HuggingFace using provided credentials

### ✅ Core Integration Components
- **Data Adapter**: Created adapter to convert Qcar2 camera data to SimLingo's expected input format
- **Control Adapter**: Developed adapter to convert SimLingo's action outputs to Qcar2 control commands

## Technical Architecture

### Input Data Flow
1. **Qcar2 Camera**: Captures images (820x410 CSI or 640x480 RGB)
2. **Data Adapter**: Resizes to 1024x512, converts BGR→RGB, normalizes to [0,1]
3. **SimLingo Model**: Processes image and generates driving actions + language outputs

### Output Control Flow
1. **SimLingo Output**: Provides driving actions (forward speed, turn angle)
2. **Control Adapter**: Maps actions to Qcar2's control interface
3. **Qcar2 Vehicle**: Executes commands via `set_velocity_and_request_state()`

### Key Adaptations Made

#### Image Format Conversion
- **From**: Qcar2 camera formats (820x410 or 640x480)
- **To**: SimLingo expected format (1024x512 RGB)
- **Method**: OpenCV resize with linear interpolation

#### Control Interface Mapping
- **From**: SimLingo action outputs (normalized throttle/steering)
- **To**: Qcar2 control parameters (forward speed m/s, turn angle radians)
- **Safety**: Clamped to safe limits (max 5.0 m/s, ±0.6 rad)

#### Environment Bridge
- **From**: CARLA simulator interface
- **To**: Qlabs virtual environment + QVL SDK
- **Method**: Adapter layer abstracting the differences

## Dependencies Installed

- **Core ML**: PyTorch 2.2.0, torchvision, transformers
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy
- **HuggingFace**: huggingface-hub, tokenizers
- **Utilities**: PyYAML, tqdm, matplotlib

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Model Integration (Priority: High)
- Create model loading and inference module
- Implement SimLingo model wrapper for Qcar2 environment
- Test model loading and basic inference

### 2. Main Integration Bridge (Priority: High)
- Develop main integration class orchestrating the complete pipeline
- Implement real-time processing loop
- Add error handling and logging

### 3. Testing and Validation (Priority: Medium)
- Create test scripts for Qlabs environment
- Validate model loading and inference
- Test end-to-end integration with Qcar2 vehicle control

### 4. Documentation and Optimization (Priority: Low)
- Complete API documentation
- Performance optimization
- User guides and troubleshooting

## Technical Specifications

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible (recommended for model inference)
- **Memory**: 8GB+ RAM (model is ~3.7GB)

### Qcar2 Interface
- **Control Method**: `set_velocity_and_request_state(forward, turn, signals...)`
- **Camera Access**: `get_image(camera_type)` returns JPG data
- **Image Formats**: CSI cameras (820x410), RGB camera (640x480)

### SimLingo Model
- **Input**: RGB images (1024x512)
- **Output**: Driving actions + language capabilities
- **Framework**: PyTorch-based transformer architecture

## Safety Considerations

- **Speed Limits**: Maximum 5.0 m/s forward speed
- **Steering Limits**: ±0.6 radians turn angle
- **Fallback Behavior**: Safe stop (0 speed, 0 turn) on errors
- **Signal Management**: Automatic brake/turn signal activation

## Current Status

The project foundation is complete with:
- ✅ Environment setup and dependencies
- ✅ Model download and storage
- ✅ Core adapter components
- ✅ Project structure and documentation

**Ready for**: Implementation of model integration and testing phases.

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-3 additional development sessions for full integration and testing.
